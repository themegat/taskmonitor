# Electron desktop app
## An Electron app I used to keep track off my time. It's was very useful when I had to fill in my timesheet at the time

It basically popups a notification after a set period to check if the user is still working on task or wishes to start a new task and it then logs/tracks/monitors the time on the tasks.
